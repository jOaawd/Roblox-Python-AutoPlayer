## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information

This program uses the Python `pynput` library to simulate key presses. Some antivirus software may flag this as suspicious behavior. The executable files are created using `pyinstaller --onefile`, which bundles the Python program and its dependencies into a single, portable executable. You are encouraged to review the scripts and generate the executable yourself for added security.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed and added to your system PATH.

### Installation

1. **Download or Clone**: Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Stereo101/python-MidiToVirtualPianoMacro/releases) and download the latest release for your operating system, or clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stereo101/python-MidiToVirtualPianoMacro
    ```

2. **Extract Files**: Extract the contents of `pyMIDI` and `playSong`. Add your MIDI files to the `midi` directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS and Linux) and install the required Python library:

    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

4. **Run the Program**:

   - Execute `pyMIDI` in your terminal. The program will list available songs from the `midi` directory.
   - Select a song to generate several files:
     - `song.txt`: The program reads this file to play the song.
     - `midiRecord.txt`: A debug log detailing the conversion process.
     - `SheetConversion.txt`: A human-readable version of `song.txt` displaying the notes in a more understandable format.
   - The program will wait for you to press the `Delete` key. Switch to your target application (e.g., Virtual Piano) and press `Delete` to start the automated playback.
